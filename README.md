# React Football
This is a cool react app for checking the standings of major European Football leagues. At the moment you can check standings for Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, Serie A, Bundesliga and Eredivisie. I've used fetch API, football-data.org Api and React for creating this app.

# Demo
You can check the demo <a href="https://imandb.github.io/react-football/" target="_blank">here</a>. Since <a href="http://www.football-data.org/index" target="_blank">football-data.org</a> is not using https, the app will not run correctly unless you load unsafe scripts. To load unsafe scripts on google Chrome check <a href="http://res.cloudinary.com/eranux/image/upload/v1509262513/Screenshot_1_eotojp.png" target="_blank">this screenshot</a>.

# Running the app
